You sent a message to the GTAG_BUG tracking system which gave (in the
Subject line or encoded into the recipient at GTAG_EMAIL_DOMAIN),
the number of a nonexistent GTAG_BUG report (LTAG_BUG_NUMBER).

This may be because that GTAG_BUG report has been resolved for more than GTAG_REMOVE_AGE
days, and the record of it has been expunged, or because you mistyped
the GTAG_BUG report number.

Your message was dated LTAG_HEADER_DATE and was sent to
LTAG_TO_ADDRESS\@GTAG_EMAIL_DOMAIN.  It had
Message-ID LTAG_HEADER_MSG_ID
and Subject LTAG_SUBJECT.

It has been filed (under junk) but otherwise ignored.

Please consult your records to find the correct GTAG_BUG report number, or
contact me, the system administrator, for assistance.

talking about this indicates a serious mail system misconfiguration
somewhere.  Please contact me immediately.)
