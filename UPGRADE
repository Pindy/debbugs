There are three new scripts that have to be installed in CGI and the front
page (or any other search you have set up) needs to be changed to use these
scripts.  They are:
	* bugreport.cgi
	* common.pl
	* pkgreport.cgi

Add the following variables to the /etc/debbugs/config file:
(the /usr/share/doc/debbugs/examples/config file can be used as a
reference)

$gSummaryList = "summary.list";         #debian-bugs-report@lists
$gSaveOldBugs = 1;

Make sure you do not have a double ,, as shown here if you're using the
default severities.  Also, 'fixed' was added to the default severities:
-                                       'normal',"Normal $gBugs",,
+                                       'normal',"Normal $gBugs",
+				                        'fixed',"NMU Fixed $gBugs",
 
These have been added to the /etc/debbugs/text file:
+############################################################################
+#  Here is a blurb to point people to ftp archive of directions.  It is
+#  used by the receive script when bouncing a badly formatted email
+#
+# $gTextInstructions = "$gBadEmailPrefix
+# $gBadEmailPrefix Instructions are available from ftp.debian.org in /debian
+# $gBadEmailPrefix and at all Debian mirror sites, in the files:
+# $gBadEmailPrefix  doc/bug-reporting.txt
+# $gBadEmailPrefix  doc/bug-log-access.txt
+# $gBadEmailPrefix  doc/bug-maint-info.txt
+# $gBadEmailPrefix";
+############################################################################
+$gTextInstructions = "$gBadEmailPrefix";
+
+
 
$gHTMLStart = "<BODY TEXT=#0F0F0F>";	#this is used by HTML generation to create the "uniform look"
 
The following code was added to /etc/debbugs/text if you use the new fixed
severity

 	<DT><CODE>wishlist</CODE>
-	<DD>for any feature request, and also for any $gBugs that are very difficult
-	to fix due to major design considerations.";
+	<DD>for any feature request, and also for any $gBugs that are very 
+	difficult to fix due to major design considerations.";
+
+	<DT><CODE>fixed</CODE>
+	<DD>fixed in the current version in the unstable archive but the fix has
+	not been fixed by the person responsible.
  
 In All such entries in /etc/debbugs/text, if you replace <BODY> with
 $gHTMLStart, all html pages will have the same look (as specified in
 $gHTMLStart):

 $gSummaryIndex = "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>$gProject $gBug report logs - summary index</TITLE>
 $gPackageLog = "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>$gProject $gBug report logs - index by package</TITLE>
