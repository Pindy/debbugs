                     DEBIAN BUG TRACKING SYSTEM
                     --------------------------

This bug tracking system was developed by Ian Jackson from 1994-1997,
with assistance from nCipher Corporation Limited in 1997.  I am grateful to
nCipher for allowing me to redistribute modifications I have made to the
system while working as an employee of nCipher (obviously I gave my
permission for nCipher to use and modify my work in this way).

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
 - GNU m4
 - GNU date
 - GNU gzip
 - Perl 5 (5.004 is known to work)
 - Lynx 2.7 or later
 - atob/btoa
 - The bug system requires its own mail domain.  It comes with code
   which understands how exim and qmail deliver mail for such a domain to a
   script.
 - If the local MTA is qmail you _must_ install a different MTA
   somewhere (eg in a subdirectory) and tell the bug system to use that;
   qmail has broken command-line parsing in its /usr/lib/sendmail
   emulation.
 - A webserver (this is easiest if the bug system can write
   directly to the webspace).
 - Somewhere to run CGI scripts (unless you don't need the `go to
   bug' and `go to package' forms to work).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a directory `config/local', alongside `config/common' and
`config/debian'.

2. Copy the template files from `config/template' to `config/local'
and edit them.  There is currently no documentation about the meanings
of the config variables, I'm afraid.  The m4 quotes have been set to
[[ and ]], so almost all definitions should use these.  Pieces of text
which do not contain DBC_... macros should be enclosed in further sets
of [[ ]] (making [[[[ ]]]] in all), as commas and other metacharacters
might otherwise be interpreted by m4 in undesirable ways.  Note that
you can also add settings for the variables mentioned in defaults.m4.

3. Set up the mail arrangements to deliver mail to the right place, and to
set up a blackhole mail alias if you need one.  Ensure that owner@bugs, if
that's what you're using, is handled by the MTA.

4. Run `./build'; if all was well run `./install'.  If `./build'
complains or there are brokennesses in the results then the files
`config/trace' (for failures during the check by `build') and
`*.trace' for each `*.in' and `*.out' may be useful.

5. Test things a bit, by sending mail messages to the bug system and
running .../scripts/processall and/or .../scripts/update-html.

6. If all seems well then install the crontab in `misc/crontab.out'.
