<h1>How to report a $gBug in $gProject</h1>

<p>Send mail to
<a href="mailto:submit\@$gEmailDomain"><code>submit\@$gEmailDomain</code></a>,
as described below.

<p>Please don't report several unrelated $gBugs - especially ones in
different packages - in one message.  Also, please don't mail your $gBug
report to any mailing lists or recipients other than
<code>submit\@$gEmailDomain</code> (for details of how to do this right, see
<a href="#xcc">below</a>).

<p>Lists of currently-outstanding $gBugs are available <a href="./">on
the World Wide Web</a> and <a href="Access.html">elsewhere</a> - see
other documents for details.

<p>You need to put a pseudo-header at the start of the body of the
message, with the <code>Package:</code> and <code>Version:</code>
lines giving the name and version of the package which has the $gBug.
(The pseudo-header fields should start at the very start of their lines.
The $gBug system does not currently understand MIME or PGP mail properly
and may fail to recognise the pseudo-headers in such mail.)

<p><em>See below for <a href="#details">further requirements</a></em>.

$gHTMLPseudoDesc

<h2><A name="example">Example</a></h2>

<p>A $gBug report, with mail header, looks something like this:
<pre>
  To: submit\@$gEmailDomain
  From: diligent\@testing.linux.org
  Subject: Hello says `goodbye'
  <A name="pseudoheader">Package: hello</a>
  Version: 1.3-16

  When I invoke `hello' without arguments from an ordinary shell
  prompt it prints `goodbye', rather than the expected `hello, world'.
  Here is a transcript:

  $ hello
  goodbye
  $ /usr/bin/hello
  goodbye
  $

  I suggest that the output string, in hello.c, be corrected.

  I am using Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, kernel 2.2.17-pre-patch-13
  and libc6 2.1.3-10.
</pre>

<h2><A name="details">Please include in your report:</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>exact</em> and <em>complete</em> text of any error
      messages printed or logged.  This is very important!
  <li>Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
  <li>A description of the incorrect behaviour: exactly what behaviour
      you were expecting, and what you observed.  A transcript of an
      example session is a good way of showing this.
  <li>A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
  <li>Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
      Include the complete text of its configuration files.

$gXtraBugInfo

</ul>

<p>Include any detail that seems relevant - you are in very little danger
of making your report too long by including too much information.  If
they are small please include in your report any files you were using
to reproduce the problem (uuencoding them if they may contain odd
characters etc.).

<p>Of course, like any email, you should include a clear, descriptive
<code>Subject</code> line in your main mail header.  The subject you
give will be used as the initial $gBug title in the tracking system, so
please try to make it informative!

<h2><A name="xcc">Sending copies of $gBug reports to other addresses</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to send a copy of a $gBug report to somewhere
else besides the mailing list and the package maintainer, which is where they
are normally sent.

<p>You could do this by CC'ing your $gBug report to the other address(es),
but then the other copies would not have the $gBug report number put in
the <code>Reply-To</code> field and the <code>Subject</code> line.
When the recipients reply they will probably preserve the
<code>submit\@$gEmailDomain</code> entry in the header and have their
message filed as a new $gBug report.  This leads to many duplicated
reports.

<p>The <em>right</em> way to do this is to use the <code>X-Debbugs-CC</code>
header.  Add a line like this to your message's mail header (<em>not</em>
to the pseudo header with the <code>Package</code> field):
<pre>
  X-Debbugs-CC: other-list\@cosmic.edu
</pre>
This will cause the $gBug tracking system to send a copy of your report
to the address(es) in the <code>X-Debbugs-CC</code> line as well as to
any mailing list.

<p>This feature can often be combined usefully with mailing
<code>quiet</code> - see below.


<h2><A name="severities">Severity levels</a></h2>

<p>If a report is of a particularly serious $gBug, or is merely a feature
request that, you can set the severity level of the $gBug as you report
it.  This is not required, however, and the developers will assign an
appropriate severity level to your report if you do not.

<p>To assign a severity level put a
<code>Severity: <var>severity</var></code> line in the pseudo-header,
together with <code>Package</code> and <code>Version</code>.  The
severity levels available are described in the
<a href="Developer.html#severities">developers' documentation</a>.


<h2>Not forwarding to the mailing list - minor $gBug reports</h2>

<p>If a $gBug report is minor (for example, a documentation typo or other
trivial build problem), or you're submitting many reports at once,
send them to <code>maintonly\@$gEmailDomain</code> or
<code>quiet\@$gEmailDomain</code>.
<code>maintonly</code> will send the report on to the package
maintainer (provided you supply a correct <code>Package</code> line in
the pseudo-header and the maintainer is known), and <code>quiet</code>
will not forward it anywhere at all but only file it as a $gBug (useful
if, for example, you are submitting many similar $gBugs and want to post
only a summary).

<p>If you do this the $gBug system will set the <code>Reply-To</code> of
any forwarded message so that replies will by default be processed in
the same way as the original report.

<h3>$gBug reports against unknown packages</h3>

<p>If the $gBug tracking system doesn't know who the maintainer of the
relevant package is it'll forward the report to
the mailing list even if <code>maintonly</code> was used.

<p>When sending to <code>maintonly\@$gEmailDomain</code> or
<var>nnn</var><code>-maintonly\@$gEmailDomain</code> you should make sure that
the $gBug report is assigned to the right package, by putting a correct
<code>Package</code> at the top of an original submission of a report,
or by using <a href="server-control.html">the
<code>control\@$gEmailDomain</code> service</a> to (re)assign the report
appropriately first if it isn't correct already.
