Debbugs, the Debian Bug Tracking System
=======================================

Configuration
-------------
Configuration is *not* complete.  Especially automatic configuration.
For first time installations, copy the config and text files out of
/usr/share/doc/debbugs/examples into /etc/debbugs.  Edit these files with
the necessary information.  Run debbugsconfig.

WWW
---
It's up to you to set up the httpd.  The basics: web files are located into 
/var/lib/debbugs/www and the CGI scripts are in /var/lib/debbugs/www/cgi.
Point your server's configuration to these places.

Mail
----
It's up to you to set up the MTA.  The basics: mail has to be DELIVERED to
the script /usr/lib/debbugs/receive via stdin.  Important environment
variables set by the MTA are used so it has to be processed from within the
MTA. See README.mail for more information.

Cron
----
Check the sample crontab in /usr/share/doc/debbugs/examples for what should
be run, in what order and how often.

Summary
-------
This was released into the distro NOW in order to start getting feed back.
The system is stable enough to use in mission critical situations.  The
bugs that will show up will be in appearance.  Variables that didn't expand
right when describing how to "foobar" or some such.

Also, people have already been asking for mods and changes and I'm having
trouble keeping track.  This way, people can start submitting bug and
wishlist reports to the BTS.
