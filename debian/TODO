TODO
====

I'll be working on 2.x changes and 3.0 concurrently...

Major Goals
-----------
1)	Allow multiple archives on the same machine.  This is actually a
feature that was lost from 1.0 in order to have runtime configurability.

2)	Move the database from flat files into... something else. LDAP or MySQL
or...?

3)
